Veterinary Information Management System written in python
Written in python OOP . Initial version will create a 'MedicalRecord' object that will encapsulate data from the objects  instantiated from clases such as 'Pet' , 'Owner', 'Visits' , etc. 'MedicalRecord' will then be converted to a dictionary containing other dictionaries. This main dictionary is then converted to json and will be stored in NoSQL database. 
This first version  will be stand alone software , ie not reliant on internet , that will work on a pc / laptop.
